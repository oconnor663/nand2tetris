# Nand2Tetris Software

This repository is a Git copy of the software from the Nand2Tetris course by
Shimon Schocken and Noam Nisan. The official source for all of this is
https://www.nand2tetris.org/software, but that site currently uses Google Drive
links that aren't suitable for automated packaging scripts (for example, the
[`nand2tetris`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/nand2tetris) package in the
[Arch Linux AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/)). The authors have licensed all of
these files under the GNU GPLv3.
